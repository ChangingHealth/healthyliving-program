# Healthy Living for people with type 2 diabetes
Welcome to Healthy Living for people with type 2 diabetes.

Healthy Living is an online self-management support programme and accompanying structured education pathway for adults with type 2 diabetes, which NHS England has licensed and is currently redeveloping for release in early 2020. Healthy Living was originally developed by a team at University College London (UCL), and provides information about type 2 diabetes and its treatments, offers emotional support, and helps with adopting and maintaining healthy behaviours (e.g. diet, exercise). Healthy Living offers an alternative means of accessing support alongside more traditional group based structured education programmes, which is intended to increase access to these services.

Healthy Living has a strong evidence base proving its effectiveness. A randomised control trial (RCT), funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) demonstrated modest but significant improvements amongst the group using the Healthy Living diabetes tool in HbA1c levels. In addition to this, the UCL team also designed an implementation study demonstrating the feasibility of rolling Healthy Living out at scale.
